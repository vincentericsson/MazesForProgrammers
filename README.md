# Mazes for Programmers

The code in this repository is my code written when following the book "Mazes for Programmers" by Jamis Buck (The Pragmatic Programmers). Some of the code will be from this book and some will be me my solutions to problems or just me playing around.

The book is made for us programmers that want something fun to do on our spare time, some coding that is different from what we do every day. It is a book on generating and traversing mazes.

Why mazes? Bacause they are fun.
